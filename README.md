# get_next_line

## Overview

**get_next_line** is a project at 42 that challenges you to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. This function is designed to work with any type of file, handling edge cases like partial reads, large files, and buffer management.

## Function Prototype

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

## Project Requirements

- The function should return the next line from the file each time it's called.
- A line is defined as a sequence of characters ending with a newline character (`\n`) or the end of file (EOF).
- Must handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Efficient memory management is crucial; no memory leaks should occur.
- The function should behave correctly even with large files or when reading from standard input.

## Key Skills Developed

- **File I/O Handling:** Learn to manage file descriptors and buffered reading.
- **Memory Management:** Master dynamic memory allocation and ensure proper cleanup.
- **String Manipulation:** Enhance your ability to handle and manipulate strings.
- **Buffer Management:** Efficiently handle buffers and data across multiple reads.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Develop the ability to manage complex edge cases and unusual file structures.

## Usage

To use the `get_next_line` function, include it in your project and call it with the desired file descriptor:

```c
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
char *line;

while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
    printf("%s", line);
    free(line);
}
close(fd);
```

## Testing

You can test the function with various files, including:
- Empty files.
- Files with multiple lines.
- Files without newline characters.
- Standard input (using file descriptor `0`).

## Conclusion

Completing the **get_next_line** project will sharpen your skills in C programming, particularly in file handling, memory management, and string manipulation. This project is a fundamental step in the 42 curriculum, preparing you for more advanced coding challenges.
