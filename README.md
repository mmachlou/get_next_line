# get_next_line
The "get_next_line" project at 42 requires you to write a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, returning it each time it's called. You'll manage memory dynamically, handle buffers, and address edge cases like partial reads or large files, all while adhering to 42's coding norms and best practices.
